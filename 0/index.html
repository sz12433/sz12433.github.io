            It seems that with a close-up selfie shot, the face is slightly distorted due to the short distance between our face and the camera lens. Our cameras
            may pick up more on the features that are closer to the lens itself (like the nose) and stretch features that are further away. However, when we step back
            and then zoom in with the camera lens, the distance no longer picks up on super close features and may achieve a generally more flat appearance, and 
            maintain these facial proportions even when we zoom in closer from further away.

            Here, I took pictures right outside of the Exploratorium in SF! Similarly to the selfie portrait example, zooming in on an urban environment from further away
            may allow the camera lens to pick up less on closer and further details of buildings and other objects
            in the setting, creating a more flattened and compressed appearance. This may help explain why
            the image to the left looks flatter especially if we look at the shadow and shape of the monument. The closer we move to
            objects in the environment, the more distorted the scene may appear. In the image to the right, 
            the shadow of the monument is far more extended and less compressed.
